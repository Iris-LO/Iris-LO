## Hi there 👋

#### I am currently working on the MeetMyPet application's evolution. 
**MeetMyPet** is an application which allows to our pets to speak and meet eachother : the pet is at the heart of the functionalities.

For now, the last version of the project is online here ➡ http://ec2-100-26-211-150.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/.

➡ ⚙ *Javascript, Node.js, Express.Js, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, Sass, SemanticUi, LeaFlet API*


#### At the moment, I'm learning ***React*** 👩‍💻
I love learning 👩‍🎓 

### 🤝 **I am looking for a full stack developer job, near Valence or full remote.**
