I am a **fullstack developer** with a preference for **backend**. I love learning and I always try to do my best. 
<br> When I am not programming, I need to go outside in Nature. I grow my own vegetables and I do lot of sports (fitness, musculation, running - I prefer trail -, skiing, ...). For now I'm learning to play the violin :)

<br> ü§ù **I am currently working as software developer for Darwin Drones** 
<br> *I am also learning more about AWS and Angular*
